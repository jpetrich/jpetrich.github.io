title: "Building A Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D Printer"
published: true

Before the pandemic, I enjoyed using the 3d printers at my office. I wasn't very adept with
them, mainly printing models I found online with recommended settings, but I still found it
interesting and was starting to learn 3d modeling and more advanced printing techniques.
With no end in sight to work from home, I decided to purchase a 3d printer to use at home.
I decided on the [Original Prusa i3 MK3S+](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/51-original-prusa-i3-mk3s)
which is available pre-built or as a kit (at a substantial discount). I decided since the
point of getting a 3d printer was to have fun with it as a hobby, I would build it myself,
and I couldn't be happier with that decision. After the kit arrived, I built it over a week
of evenings. I took video of every step for my own reference - I wanted to be able to
refer to them to find my mistake if the printer didn't pass its self test, but decided to
post them to YouTube in case they would be helpful to any other new Prusa owners.

In addition to the step by step videos you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJBQMpoFCtCFGM209no83YHeww7uSbnJG), I uploaded a time-lapse of
each major stage of assembly:
