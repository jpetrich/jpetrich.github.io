title: "How I learn new things"

In most situations, it is more important to be able to learn something, than to already
know it. When starting most jobs, it is rare that you will be expected to
be adept at everything required for that job on day one. Your success will be measured by
your ability to learn how to perform well in new situations, and to become an expert in
subjects you previously left undiscovered. Even if your job doesn't require such
adaptability - perhaps you are a surgeon, a pilot, or a skilled tradesman - learning new
things opens up other avenues of opportunity in your personal life through hobbies, shared
interests with friends and family, and financial wellbeing. In this article, I'd like to
share how I think about learning new things, with a few examples that I hope will help you
too.

## What do I want to learn?

When I identify something I want to learn, it usually takes the form of a problem statement
rather than a direct question. Sometimes the problem statement is open-ended, such as, "How
can I get the skills necessary to be a better leader?" and sometimes it is more focused,
as in, "What's this 'decentralized finance' term I've been hearing, and should I invest
time and effort into it?" In the first case, I haven't narrowed the problem space down
enough to start doing meaningful learning, and in the second, I have a fairly concrete
question that I can answer before directing my search for knowledge further. When I have a
broad problem statement, I like to get a handle on it by asking some more targeted
questions. This helps me identify the right way to work towards an answer, and often leads
me to reject the initial problem statement once I have a better understanding of the space.
For example, if I've identified I want to become a better leader, I'd ask myself, "Who are
some people I think of as great leaders, and how did they become great?" "Why do I want to
be a better leader?" "What makes me think I'm not already as good a leader as I need to
be?" The answers to these questions will help me find the right people to talk to, identify
other ways to accomplish my underlying motivation for the initial goal, and narrow down my
objective so I can ask better questions faster.


## Find enthusiasts

When I've identified what I want to know, I try to identify people who already know about
it. Sometimes this means having a conversation with someone I know who is already
knowledgeable to get recommendations for books, videos or websites. When I wanted to learn
classical philosophy, I asked a friend's wife, who majored in philosophy, for book
recommendations, and walked away having resolved to read Plato's <u>Republic</u>. Usually
though, I don't have such a great personal connection, and in such
circumstances, I've found that online forums are really useful to get a pulse on a topic
and how experts, or at least enthusiasts, approach it. For many topics I've wanted to learn
about, including aquariums, 3d printing, mechanical keyboards, whisky, and coffee, Reddit
has been a great introduction. I usually browse recent posts to see if I can get a good
general sense of the quality of discussion, and also look at the top posts of the past
month and year to identify what has excited the community the most recently. As an example,
going to reddit.com/r/coffee today shows that people are interested in grind size
distribution, the merits of various coffee machines and grinders, optimizing coffee taste
from bean storage through brewing, and debugging their espresso machines. Zooming out to
the top posts of the past year reveals interesting questions about working in coffee,
scientific inquiry into how the chemistry of water affects taste, and how the coronavirus
impacts one's enjoyment of coffee. If you've heard of "specialty coffee" and wanted to get
an idea of what that term entails, browsing these few Reddit posts would give you a great
introduction. For other topics, another forum may be more popular. Ham radio, for instance,
has active subreddits, but there is more activity on other forums like qrz.com.

## Take a deep dive

Sometimes, taking a survey and reading the thoughts
of enthusiasts is enough to give me the context I'm looking for. At this point I might
be satisfied - perhaps I realized I'm not as interested as I thought I would be, or I have
enough information to do the part of my job that required some insight. Often, though,
this broad context whets my appetite for more. Depending on the subject, going deep looks
different - the best and most fundamental material might take the form of textbooks,
literature, or videos. Again, I lean on the community to point me to these resources. Many
online communities maintain wikis filled with links for beginners. I find it useful to
make use of these resources, even if they appear tangential to what I'm trying to learn
both because these resources will point to others, and because it's useful to reference
them when engaging with the community in the future. Posts like "I read A, B, and C from
the 'getting started' guide and had these questions..." will get a much more useful and
positive response than "Tell me about X."

## Learn by teaching

After a few days of immersing myself in a topic - reading forum posts, articles, and
books, watching videos, and listening to podcasts, I'll either feel confident in my
newfound knowledge, amazed at how much there still is to learn, or befuddled by the
variety of conflicting things I've read. To clarify my own thoughts and distill them into
coherency, I find it very helpful to teach someone else. As Flannery O'Connor said, "I
write because I don't know what I think until I read what I say." Whether it's through
writing or talking about it, outputting what I've learned helps me identify what I'd bet
on and what's still rolling around in my head trying to find its resting place. Another benefit of sharing is getting someone else's thoughts and questions. When I've discussed
topics I'm starting to learn about with other novices, I've received great fundamental
questions that help me refocus my attention on basic understanding, and when I've
had conversations with subject-matter experts after learning the fundamentals, I've been
able to understand their insights, accelerating my learning process.
